abstract = {Digital twins have become an important part of the systems and software modeling world. Generally, the focus has been on creating digital twins of the item being designed, tested, and produced. However, the test lab itself is important to be part of the modeling lifecycle as the health and calibration of the test systems in use can greatly affect the final product. In this paper we describe SystemLink™ software, a web-based manager of digital twins of the testing resources in a validation lab. We describe the architecture of SystemLink and how having robust digital twins of test systems and assets improves the overall lifecycle of products under test.},
