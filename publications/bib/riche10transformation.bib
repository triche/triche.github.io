abstract="Multicore, multithreaded processors are rapidly becoming the platform of choice for high-throughput request-processing applications (RPAs). We refer to this class of modern parallel platforms as multi-⋆ systems. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of Lagniappe, a translator that simplifies RPA development by transforming portable models of RPAs to high-throughput multi-⋆ executables. We demonstrate Lagniappe's effectiveness with a pair of stateful RPA case studies.",
