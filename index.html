          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <p>
            I am the Director of Technology and Innovation Software for
            Emerson's Test and Measurement business. With 25 years of experience
            in software innovation, I lead the development of advanced software
            technologies that power Emerson's Intelligent Test solutions,
            helping customers drive greater efficiency and success. I focus on
            accelerating innovation across our software portfolio by harnessing
            the latest advancements in technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to my current role, I held several key positions within
            National Instruments (now Emerson's Test and Measurement business),
            contributing to flagship products such as NI LabVIEW and NI
            SystemLink.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from The University of Texas at
            Austin, where my research focused on the intersection of parallel
            programming, computer networking, and model-driven software
            engineering.

          <p>
            I have worked in various roles in leadership and development in the
            software industry for the last 25 years.

            <li>BIOS developer at IBM</li>
            <li>
              Graduate Research Assistant and Postdoctoral Fellow at UT Austin
              while in academia

            This breadth of experience all led to my current role directing the
            adoption of advanced technologies, such as generative AI, in the NI
            Software Platform.

              <strong>Design by Transformation</strong>: Using agent mode I've
              been able to build a UI for the work I did, partially in my
              dissertation, but mainly as a postdoc. Building UIs as a single
              researcher wasn't really possible in the late 2000s, but this has
              been a game changer.
